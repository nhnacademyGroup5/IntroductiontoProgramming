computer languages : are the languages through which the user can communicate with the computer by writing program
instructions.

- Machine languages : is the only language which can be understood by the computer. Binary language is an example of a
  low-level language. As the cpu understands the binary language instructions.

- High-level language : is a computer language which can be understood by the users. it is similar to human language and

# 1.12 The first Java program

- Java is case-sensitive, there is difference between lower-case and upper-case letter.
  -Ex class is different from Class.

<br/>

# 1.16 Note on the portability of Java

- Java compiler produce code that is independent of the specific computer and is called Java bytecode.
- Java program is platform independent

-Programs - The programs characterize what a computer actually does.
-objects     : a representation of the information relative to the domain of interest.
-operations  : a description of how to manipulate the representation in such a way as to realize the desired
functionality.
