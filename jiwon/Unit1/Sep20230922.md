## Definition vs Declaration - [link](https://www.javatpoint.com/difference-between-declaration-and-definition)

- Declaration : are used to give program names, including variables, namespaces, functions, and classes.
- Definition : identifies the code or data connected with the function, class, variable. the compiler requires the
  definition to allocate storage space for the defined objects. When a variable is defined, it takes up memory in the
  form of multiple bytes.

## Assignment vs initialization [link](http://guidetojava.com/mydoc/5d_VariableInit.html)

- Assignment is whenever you ar storing data in the variable.
- Initialization is when you assign data to variable for the first time.

```java 
int a; //declaration
        int b=5; // declaration , initialization, definition, assignment
        a=6 // assignment, initialization, definition
        b=7 // assignment, definition
```

## Expression vs statement

- Expression is any word or group of words or symbols that is a value
- Statement is a group of expressions and/or statements that uou design to carry out a task or an action.

```java
int price=500 // int, price, =, 500 - expression
        // int price = 500; - statement
        int multiply=function(firstNumber,secondNumber){
        return firstNumber*secondNumber; //funtion and class - both statements and expression
        }
```
